  * <strong>Academic</strong>
  <ul style="text-align: justify;"> I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/">Deakin University</a>, School of Information Technologies, Burwood, Melbourne. Before that, I was at RMIT University, Melbourne. My research spans systems security, reliability, and scalability, with recent work focusing on anomaly detection and blockchain forensics. [See my research focus <a href="https://nasrin-sohrabi.github.io/research/"> here</a>].</ul> 
  
  <ul>I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at RMIT University under the supervsion of Professor Zahir Tari. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (Software) and an Honours degree in Computer Science.</ul> 
  
  <ul>I also lead the Resilient and Scalable Computing Group <a href="https://rscg-research.gitlab.io/rscg.gitlab.io">[RSCG]</a>, fostering collaborations across academia and industry. If you are an academic or an industry practitioner and are interested in joining or collaborating with the group, please feel free to email me. </ul>

  <ul style="text-align: justify; color: red"> I am always looking for self-motivated PhD students who possess a strong background in system security, distributed computing, and machine learning. Please email me your CV, transcript, research statement (no more than 200 words), and english test score. </ul>

  * <strong>Industry</strong>
  <ul style="text-align: justify;"> I also have a decade of industry experience as a Senior Software Engineer, developing secure, scalable, and high-performance products in the digital payments domain. My work spanned transaction processing systems and advanced fraud-detection capabilities, including credit card fraud prevention using serverless inference models at the core of leading digital payment platforms.</ul>

======

<span style=" text-align: justify;"> 

  * <strong>Systems Security in Decentraliased and Cloud/Edge Platforms</strong>
    <ul style=" text-align: justify;"> My research focuses on strengthening the security of decentralised and cloud/edge-based systems through anomaly detection that adapts to concept drift and adversarial behaviours. A key strand of this work extends to blockchain forensics, where anomaly detection techniques are applied to <span style="font-style: bold"> identify scams, fraud </span>, and other illicit activities embedded in transaction networks. By combining adaptive detection with system-level monitoring, my aim is to enhance trust and resilience in large-scale, dynamic infrastructures.</ul>

  * <strong>Distributed Systems Reliability and Performance</strong>
      <ul style=" text-align: justify;"> I investigate how distributed systems maintain reliability and scalability in the presence of faults and adversarial threats. My research focuses on (1) consensus protocols for blockchain and distributed environments that must balance security, throughput, and energy efficiency, while also enabling forensic visibility to support fraud and scam detection; and (2) fault-tolerance mechanisms for stream-processing frameworks that ensure consistent low-latency analytics under failures.</ul> -->

<span style="font-size:20px;">Current Projects</span>
======

<span style=" text-align: justify;">  
 
  * <strong>CRC-P Project:</strong> Fraud detection within digital payment systems, more specifically cryptocurreny transactions. Our project aims to develop a digital platform consisting of novel anti-fraud and anti-money laundering techniques, to align Crypto transactions with traditional payment options such as credit cards.  

  * <strong>Cryptocurrency scams:</strong> the goal is to understand how the scams work, how to detect them, and scammers's tactics.  

  * <strong>Distributed Systems Scalability/Performance:</strong> The project aims to improve the scalability and performance of distributed systems. We focus on developing a new consensus algorithm that can be used in distributed systems to improve their performance and scalability. -->
