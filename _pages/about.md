<span style="text-align: justify;"></span>
  <ul style="text-align: justify;"> I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/">Deakin University</a>, School of Information Technologies, Burwood, Melbourne. Before that, I was at RMIT University, Melbourne. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at RMIT University. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (Software) and an Honours degree in Computer Science. </ul>

  <ul style="text-align: justify;"> I am on the lookout for graduate and undergraduate students who possess a strong background in system security, distributed computing, and machine learning. If you're passionate about system research, feel free to email me your CV. </ul>

======

<span style=" text-align: justify;"> 

  * Systems Security in Decentraliased and Cloud/Edge Platforms
      <ul><span style=" text-align: justify;">  My research focuses on strengthening the security of decentralised and cloud/edge-based systems through anomaly detection that adapts to concept drift and adversarial behaviours. A key strand of this work extends to blockchain forensics, where anomaly detection techniques are applied to identify scams, fraud, and other illicit activities embedded in transaction networks. By combining adaptive detection with system-level monitoring, my aim is to enhance trust and resilience in large-scale, dynamic infrastructures.</span></ul>

  * Distributed Systems Reliability and Performance
      <ul> <span style=" text-align: justify;"> I investigate how distributed systems maintain reliability and scalability in the presence of faults and adversarial threats. My research focuses on (1) consensus protocols for blockchain and distributed environments that must balance security, throughput, and energy efficiency, while also enabling forensic visibility to support fraud and scam detection; and (2) fault-tolerance mechanisms for stream-processing frameworks that ensure consistent low-latency analytics under failures.</span></ul>

======

<span style=" text-align: justify;">  
 
  * CRC-P Project: Fraud detection within digital payment systems, more specifically cryptocurreny transactions. Our project aims to develop a digital platform consisting of novel anti-fraud and anti-money laundering techniques, to align Crypto transactions with traditional payment options such as credit cards.  

  * Cryptocurrency scams: the goal is to understand how the scams work, how to detect them, and scammers's tactics.  

  * Distributed Systems Scalability/Performance: The project aims to improve the scalability and performance of distributed systems. We focus on developing a new consensus algorithm that can be used in distributed systems to improve their performance and scalability.
