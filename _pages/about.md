I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at Deakin University, School of Information Technologies, Burwood, Melbourne, Australia. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at RMIT University under the guidance/supervision of Professor Zahir Tari. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (Software) and an Honours degree in Computer Science. 
      
     
I am always on the lookout for graduate and undergraduate students who possess a strong background in system security and performance/scalability. If you're passionate about system research, feel free to email me your CV.

My Research Interest
======

 My primary research interests lie in the realms of systems security and scalability/performance, particularly in: 

  <li>Systems security, including decentralised and cloud/edge-based systems, with a focus on anomaly detection</li>
  <li>Enhancing the reliability, scalability, and performance of large-scale distributed systems, with an emphasis on fault tolerance in various systems (such as stream processing) and consensus algorithms in different environments (such as blockchain systems)</li>
