<span style="font-size:20px;">About Me</span>
======
I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at Deakin University, School of Information Technologies, Burwood, Melbourne, Australia. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at RMIT University under the guidance/supervision of Professor Zahir Tari. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (Software) and an Honours degree in Computer Science. 
      
    
I am always on the lookout for graduate and undergraduate students who possess a strong background in system security and performance/scalability. If you're passionate about system research, feel free to email me your CV.

 * My Research Interest: 

   My primary research interests lie in the realms of systems security and scalability/performance, particularly in: 

     * Systems security, including decentralised and cloud/edge-based systems, with a focus on anomaly detection.
     * Enhancing the reliability, scalability, and performance of large-scale distributed systems, with an emphasis on fault tolerance in various systems (such as stream processing) and consensus algorithms in different environments (such as blockchain systems).


 <span style="font-size:20px;">My Current research topics/projects:</span>
======
  * CRC-P Project - I am currently participating as a Chief Investigator (CI) in a Collaborative Research Centre Project (CRC-P) focused on enhancing fraud detection within digital payment systems, more specifically cryptocurreny transactions. The worldwide cryptocurrency (crypto) market is a rapidly growing form of digital exchange, however, despite its significant size and growth, various security and operational challenges, particularly concerning the liquidity and safety of these currencies, hinder their widespread adoption and use. Our project aims to create develop a digital platform consisting of novel anti-fraud and anti-money laundering techniques, to align Crypto transactions with traditional payment options such as credit cards.  

  * Cryptocurrency scams: the goal is to understand how the scams work, how to detect them, and scammers's tactics.  
  * Distributed Systems Scalabilities/Performance: The project aims to improve the scalability and performance of distributed systems. We focus on developing a new consensus algorithm that can be used in distributed systems to improve their performance and scalability.
