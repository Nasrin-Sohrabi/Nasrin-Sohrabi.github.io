<span style=" text-align: justify;"> 
I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/">Deakin University</a>, School of Information Technologies, Burwood, Melbourne, Australia. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at RMIT University under the guidance/supervision of Professor Zahir Tari. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (Software) and an Honours degree in Computer Science. </span>

======

<span style=" text-align: justify;"> 

 * Primary research interests lie in the realms of <span style="font-weight:bold">systems security and scalability/performance</span>, particularly in: 

     * Systems security, including decentralised and cloud/edge-based systems, with a focus on <span style="font-weight:bold">anomaly detection</span>.
     * Enhancing the <span style="font-weight:bold">reliability, scalability, and performance of large-scale distributed systems</span>, with an emphasis on <span style="font-weight:bold">fault tolerance</span> in various systems (such as stream processing) and consensus algorithms in different environments (such as blockchain systems).

 * Current research topics/projects:

      * CRC-P Project: Fraud detection within digital payment systems, more specifically cryptocurreny transactions. Our project aims to create develop a digital platform consisting of novel anti-fraud and anti-money laundering techniques, to align Crypto transactions with traditional payment options such as credit cards.  

      * Cryptocurrency scams: the goal is to understand how the scams work, how to detect them, and scammers's tactics.  

      * Distributed Systems Scalability/Performance: The project aims to improve the scalability and performance of distributed systems. We focus on developing a new consensus algorithm that can be used in distributed systems to improve their performance and scalability.
