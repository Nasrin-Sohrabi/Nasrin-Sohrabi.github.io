        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        <ul>
           <p>In this section you can read about the projects that I am currently invovled/working on. 
            Contact me if you are interested in any of these projects</p>
        <ul>
             <li> <strong>ARC LP</strong>
               <div class="inner-div"; style=" text-align: justify;">
               <p> I am currently serving as a Chief Investigator (CI) on an ARC Linkage Project titled 
                <strong>"An Intelligent Resilience Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems."</strong> 
                This project focuses on creating an intelligent cyber resilience platform capable of autonomously identifying, explaining, and prioritising cyber threats 
                and associated risks within cyber-physical systems (CPS). Its goal is to enhance the resilience of Australiaâ€™s critical infrastructure and enable rapid recovery from evolving cyber threats.

                Key outcomes include automated threat modelling, adaptive risk estimation, and a digital cyber twin testbed to support evaluation of resilient response strategies.
     
                Two major lines of research in this project are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Intelligent models for autonomous identification, explanation, and prioritisation of cyber threats in CPS</li>
                  <li>Resilience-focused methods for adaptive, risk-informed decision-making under cyber uncertainty</li>
                </ul>
               </div>
             </li>
             
             <br>

             <li><strong>CRC-P Project</strong>
                <div class="inner-div"; style=" text-align: justify;">
                    <p> I am currently participating as a Chief Investigator (CI) in a Collaborative Research Centre Project (CRC-P) 
                    focused on enhancing <span style="font-weight:bold">fraud detection </span> within digital payment systems, more specifically cryptocurreny transactions.
                    The worldwide cryptocurrency (crypto) market is a rapidly growing form of digital exchange, 
                    however, despite its significant size and growth, various security and operational challenges, particularly concerning the liquidity and safety of these currencies,
                    hinder their widespread adoption and use.
                    Our project aims to create develop a digital platform consisting of novel anti-fraud and anti-money laundering techniques, to align Crypto transactions with traditional payment options such as credit cards. 
                    
                    Two major lines of research conducted under this project is as follows:    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cybersecurity Scam </li>
                        <li>Cybersecuirty Fraud</li>
                    </ul>
                   </p>
                </div>
            </li>           

            <li><strong> System Security</strong>
                 <div class="inner-div"; style=" text-align: justify;">
                  <p>System security has been always a challenging task. I am currently working on a project that aims to improve the security of IoT systems. 
                   More specifically focusing on <span style="font-weight:bold"> anomaly detection </span>in IoT systems.
                  <ul>
                     <li> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10184745">Anomaly Detection in IoT Data Streams</a></li>    
                  </ul> 
                  </p>
                 </div>
            </li>
        
          <li> <stron>Distributed Systems Scalabilities/Performance</stron>
             <div class="inner-div"; style=" text-align: justify;">
                <p> This project aims to improve the scalability and performance of distributed systems. 
                It focuses on developing a new <span style="font-weight:bold">consensus algorithm</span> that can be used in distributed systems to improve their performance and scalability.
                 <ul>
                   <li> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9920227">Consensus Algorithm</a></li>
